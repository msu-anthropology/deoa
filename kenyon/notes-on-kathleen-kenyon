Jericho:
 - British archaeologist John Garstang was who excavated Jericho prior to Kathleen
 - She went to check his work and found out his dating was off by about 2,000 years
 - Invented the Wheeler box grid system (Wheeler-Kenyon) method which was about stratigraphy and not just finding entire sites
 - Focused on pottery sherds and not just whole pieces - was able to better come to conclusions about dates, etc.
 - Really focused on and used carbon-14 dating to better grasp time frame
 - Found Jericho to be dated back to the Early Bronze Age
 - Criticism for the time consuming process, the fact she was only digging small bits, and she was "not able to see the big picture"
 - Books: Digging up Jericho and Excavations at Jericho as well as others 
 - Believed archaeology was needed to prove the bible since the bible was told through word of mouth
