Before Deetz could receive his degree, he served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War from 1951 to 1955 <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="James Fanto Deetz (1930-2000) Curriculum Vitae & Personal History.

Deetz published his dissertation called, “An Archaeological Approach to Kinship Change in Eighteenth Century Arikara Culture” in 1960, and shortly after, he earned his doctoral degree <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brown, Marley R.

			<p> Deetz’s dissertation work mainly focused on his findings from the Medicine Crow site in South Dakota during the late 1950’s <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brown, Marley R. Memorial: James Fanto Deetz, 1930–2000. Historical Archaeology 38.2 (2004): 103-23. The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois. Web. 01 May 2016."> (Brown, “Memorial” 106).</a>  He examined many artifacts at the site, but his most notable work there was based on pottery rim sherds. A colleague of Deetz had mentioned in passing how “pottery with certain deigns seemed to be clustered in different structures” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brown, Marley R. Memorial: James Fanto Deetz, 1930–2000. Historical Archaeology 38.2 (2004): 103-23. The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois. Web. 01 May 2016."> (Brown, “Memorial” 106).</a>  Deetz’s research at the site in combination with his colleague’s statement caused Deetz to an important discovery: there was a relationship between the pottery and residence patterns of the Arikara people who used to reside at the Medicine Crow site. From excavating the site, over 2,000 rim sherds were acquired and Deetz analyzed the sherds by running multiple comparison tests that were based on certain attributes of the ceramics <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Johnson, Craig. “Book Review: The Dynamics of Stylistic Change in Arikara Ceramics by James Deetz.” The Nebraska Anthropologist 2.

				<p>James Deetz also was involved in the creation of Plimoth Plantation, a museum for Native Americans and Pilgrims.

				<p> James Deetz’s use of technology in archaeology was the first of its kind, making him one of the pioneers for digital archaeology and an innovative thinker, for he was ahead of his time. Prior to the 1950’s, the archaeological method was not technology based; everything was done by hand. It was a meticulous process, for the context or the location and relation of artifacts to other objects is crucial data archaeologists wanted to collect, and since sites could not be re-excavated, archaeologists wanted to make sure they were making a detailed, accurate, and permanent record of their findings, so that the information was preserved and could not be lost. However, there was the problem of how to analyze, organize, and use the huge amount of acquired data. In the case of Deetz’s dissertation work at the Medicine Crow Site, he recovered over 2,000 rim sherds <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brown, Marley. “J. C. Harrington Medal in Historical Archaeology: James Deetz.” Historical Archaeology 31.4 (1997). The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois. Web. 01 May 2016."> (Brown, “J. C. Harrington Medal”).</a> If Deetz were to perform the relative dating technique seriation by hand, in order to organize all of his data, it would have taken him quite some time to do so. However, Deetz had the idea of using a computer to look for “‘stylistic coherence”’ among the rim sherds <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brown, Marley. “J. C. Harrington Medal in Historical Archaeology: James Deetz.” Historical Archaeology 31.4 (1997). The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois. Web. 01 May 2016."> (Brown, “J. C. Harrington Medal”).</a>  Instead of relative dating by hand, Deetz used an IBM 704 for the task. He coded the specific traits he saw on the rim sherds onto cards that he fed into the IBM 704, and he created a program that would accomplish the seriation he initially was going to do by hand. In the 1950s and 1960s, using technology in this manner was unheard of, so when Deetz published his use of technology in archaeology in <i>The Dynamics of Stylistic Change in Arikara Ceramics in 1965</i>, archaeologists were surprised <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A Summary of James Deetz's Work & Publications. The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois, n.d. Web. 01 May 2016."> ("A Summary of James Deetz's Work & Publications"). </a>   Deetz continued using this technique, such as with his work of seriation on gravestones. His technique was later coined as computational seriation, and his use of computers impacted the field of archaeology, for it was a case study that showed that the methodology of archaeology could expand greatly by using computers.

				<p> When it comes to historical archaeology, Deetz is one of the most notable figures in the field. Historical archaeology focuses on also incorporating information from the written record, such as from historic documents or publications. Deetz use of the written record in conjunction with the archaeological record, emphasized at the time how powerful historical archaeology could be. Deetz believed that depending solely on the written record would be unwise, for “if only the written records…are studied, then the conclusions will reflect on the story of a small minority of deviant, wealth, white males, and little else” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Feder, Kenneth L. Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. Second ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print."> (Feder 77).</a> Basically, to Deetz, the written record was filled with biases and it only represented a small piece of history. However, Deetz was not opposed to using information from historical documents if he was using it along with data from material culture. From Deetz's findings in the Flowerdew Hundred Plantation, he recognized that using the archaeological and written record together was impactful, for he claimed that viewing “each body of data as complementary and unique in its own right, and [moving] back and forth from each” was pivotal in helping him draw the conclusions he made <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Orser, Charles E. Historical Documents: Using Historical Documents and Archaeological Evidence. Encyclopedia of Historical Archaeology. London: Routledge, 2002. 269. Print."> (Orser 269).</a> 
 Deetz helped establish the importance of using more than one form of data, and his style of analysis has earned him high regard in the historical archaeology department.

Web. 01 May 2016."> ("James Fanto Deetz (1930-2000) Curriculum Vitae & Personal History").</a> James Deetz was recognized for his accomplishments and his most memorable and revolutionary contributions to the field of archaeology are first, his methods. For example, Deetz use of computers in computational seriation introduced archaeology to technology. In the present, archaeology is very reliant on technology. The digitalizing of archaeology has created faster data collecting techniques, preservation of more data and sites, and more accessibility to data. Therefore, much of the potential and efficiency of archaeology today can be attributed to James Deetz's initial use of the IBM 704. In addition, Deetz emphasized the importance of not depending on one type of data in archaeology. He was a supporter of using multiple kinds of data, for he claimed, “’…the combined use of archaeological and documentary materials should permit us to say something about the past that could not have been said using only one set of data’" <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Boroughs, J. Jason. A New Insight into the Early Settlement of Plymouth Plantation. The Plymouth Colony Archive Project. University of Illinois, n.d. Web. 22 Apr. 2016."> (Boroughs).</a>  From this belief, Deetz shaped historical archeology into the important branch it is today. <figure style= "padding-right:12px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: left; width: 60%">
